## Description
Built as a capstone final project at DevBootcamp, a 9-week immersive coding school, Conways is a React Native mobile artistic experience combining Conway's Game of Life with music, color, and user control! The app revolves around simulation of cellular/colony style growth, propagation, survival, and digital death!

## Design
Initial design involves a twist on the classic grid system, incorporating the rarer hexagon format for variety and flair!

## Current Barebones Core MVP
- A user can open the app and see a landing screen with logo and styles
- A user pushes a start button on the landing screen to reveal the game
- A user sees a borderless menu of hexagon shapes overlaid on the game allowing start/pause/reset functionality
- A user can re-reference the rules of life from the overlay/borderless hex menu
- A user can expect full test coverage
- A user can expect a fully performant app

## Current Core Stretch
- A user can touch the screen to set custom colony/cell configurations before starting the game
- A user can hear procedurally generated music associated with the growth or decay of their colonies
- A user can rotate the screen to benefit from landscape view on native devices
