## Description
Built as a capstone final project at DevBootcamp, a 9-week immersive coding school, Conways is a React Native mobile artistic experience combining Conway's Game of Life with music, color, and user control! The app revolves around simulation of cellular/colony style growth, propagation, survival, and digital death!

## Design
Project design focused on the classic version of Conway's Game of Life, with inspired modern elements. The base game is made with React Native, utilizing HTML5's Canvas element and Vanilla JS to calculate growth & death, drawing the game board in real time via a WebView component loading local assets.

## Incorporated User Stories
- A user can open the app and see a landing screen with logo and styles
- A user pushes a start button on the landing screen to reveal the game
- A user sees a border-less game menu overlaid on the game allowing start/pause/reset functionality
- A user can access a menu screen from a single menu button overlaid on the game
- A user can re-reference the rules from this menu screen
- A user can expect full test coverage
- A user can expect relatively efficient performance from the app

## Currently In Development
- A user can touch the screen to set custom colony/cell configurations before starting the game
- A user can hear procedurally generated music associated with the growth or decay of their colonies
- A user can see colored and styled cells while playing the game
