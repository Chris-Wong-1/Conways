## Description
Built as a capstone final project at DevBootcamp, a 9-week immersive coding school, Conways is a React Native mobile artistic experience combining Conway's Game of Life with music, color, and user control! The app revolves around simulation of cellular/colony style growth, propagation, survival, and digital death!

## Design
Project design focused on the classic version of Conway's Game of Life, with inspired modern elements. The base game is made with React Native, utilizing HTML5's Canvas element and Vanilla JS to calculate growth & death, drawing the game board in real time via a WebView component loading local assets.

## Incorporated User Stories
- A user can touch the screen to generate new live cells and interact with the game as it evolves
- A user can expect responsive performance from the game
- A user can open the app and see a landing screen with logo and styles
- A user can push a start button on the landing screen to reveal the game
- A user sees a border-less game menu allowing start/pause/reset functionality
- A user can access an about page from the landing screen
- A user can access a rules explanation page from the landing screen
- A user can see colored and styled cells while playing the game
- A user can hear music associated with the growth or decay of their colonies

## Currently In Development
- A user can pick different cell sizes from the in-game menu
- A user can select from themes for cell colors
- A user can select different simulation speeds for the game
